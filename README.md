# iTunesAirBridge

## About
Uses the Adobe Air 2.0 Beta NativeProcess API to interact with iTunes.

library and all of your playlists and allows you to do simple playback.

All playack is handled by [Playdar](http://playdar.org).

## Requirements
 - Windows only (for right now)
 - [Adobe Air 2.0 Beta](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air2.html)

 - You have to build it youself in Flex Builder to try it
 
## TODO
